# Odin - Sign Up Form

This project is intended to give you a chance to flex some of the new items you’ve been absorbing over the past few lessons. This time it’s a sign-up form for an imaginary service.

## Review

Nothing really majorly difficult in this project.

I didn't want to use `background-image` for the left image, to make use of the `position : fixed` for the paragraph, else I would have juste use the background with a `flex-end` alignement

Forms input/label went okay. Tried to do a bit of regex with the license plate, but nothing really major yet.

I hesitated to use a Framework like Tailwind or Bootstrap, but maybe for a different project.
